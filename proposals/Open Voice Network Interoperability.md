Open Voice Network Interoperability Project

## Requested Project Maturity Level
Incubation

## Project Description
The Open Voice Network Interoperability Project seeks to open and democratize Conversational AI through the definition, development, demonstration, and industry adoption of a universal API for interoperability of natural language/generative AI-enabled conversational assistants.  To do so, the Project will develop (but not be limited to) multiple open-source specifications, developer sandboxes, libraries (Python, Java, Node.js, Javascript, Java/Rust, Objective C/Swift, others), and an open-source destination identification and registry system.  

This project is lodged at the intersection of natural language AI (processing, understanding, generation) and language model generative AI. According to Precedence Research (Sept., 2023), this "conversational AI" market will grow at a 23.9% CAGR to a total available global market worth $86.4 billion (USD) by 2032.  The anticipated specifications for assistant authentication, liveness detection, the protection of user and organizational data, and interoperable system data security speak directly to Trusted & Responsible AI efforts.

The Project emerged from 2017-2018 research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Center, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel Corporation.  In Q3 2020, it was formally instituted as a project of the Open Voice Network (https://openvoicenetwork.org), a Linux Foundation community founded that year.

In 2023, and as part of the Open Voice Network, the Interoperability Project published and demonstrated the first specifications of "The Message Envelope," which is the working title of the envisioned universal API.  As of this writing (October, 2023) the initial specifications are being tested not only by Project participants, but in a proof-of-concept hosted by the Information Systems Authority (RIA) of the Republic of Estonia, which is using the Interoperability Project specifications to exchange text and acoustic dialogs among independent conversational assistants.  In addition, a developer sandbox is now being built, and is expected to be active as of January, 2024. 

## Alignment with LF AI & Data Foundation's Mission
As noted above, the Open Voice Network Interoperability Project seeks to open and democratize the rapidly growing conversational AI industry.  As such, it is working with a growing community of participants and developers at the intersection of natural language AI and language model generative AI technology, and addressing trust and ethics issues that are central to the growth and stability of an open, democratized industry, such as assistant authentication, liveness detection, protection of user and organizational data, and interoperable system data security. 

## Possible Collaboration Opportunities with Current LF AI Hosted Projects
The Open Voice Network Interoperability Project sees numerous potential collaboration opportunities with current LF AI & Data hosted projects.  These include

* ONNX (best practices for interoperability standards)
* Delta (natural language and speech processing platform)
* The AI Frameworks workstream of the Generative AI Commons
* The Models workstream of the Generative AI Commons
